# Wine & Code

Wine & Code is a coding workshop ran every-other week(ish).


### What to expect

These sessions are more focused on Top-down learning, where we'll learn about big and interesting topics, like cryptocurrencies, Machine learning, website design, or home automation, and we'll work together in filling in the gaps of knowledge. It will also be expected that participants will have their own project they are working on. Myself and the rest of the group will be there to help you when you get stuck, or provide direction. Don't worry if you don't have something in mind, coming up with something is part of the fun!

What we will be covering next will be decided by the group so that it stays interesting and applicable for everyone.


### Where and When
Our sesions will be ran in The Tannery Building. We'll first meet at Settlement Co. on Victoria, and walk over. If you are running late or can't make it, just let us know on Slack.

### What to Bring
Just yourself and a laptop. If you are feeling generous you can bring some snacks to share.


### Why am I doing this?
I've ran several workshops in the past and I've been frustrated with several things. It took way too long to get to interesting topics, many of my students didn't really know how to apply what they were learning, and writing a cirriculum is a _ton_ of work.

So the plan here is to keep it small, keep it personalized, and keep it self-directed. We learn things you find interesting and we are going to apply what you are learning right away.
